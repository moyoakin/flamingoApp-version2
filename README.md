# üßê Project Details

> The flamingo version 2 app is a web application that can be used for any Menu Reservation business it is designed in such a way that the UI is very user friendly and easy to use by anyone.

# üßê Technologies Used

- This project uses the [React JS framework](https://react.org/).React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MongoDB] package which allows developer to create a custom storage schema and save it to a database.
- For the sign in authentication functionality in the application I used the [JSon Web Token] to implement the authentication functionality.
  - üö® Currently, I have not finished implementing the google cloud storage configuration but on completion of this application images will be stored on google cloud while other datas comes from Moongoose .
